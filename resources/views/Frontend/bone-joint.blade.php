                <p class="mb-4">Geriatric bone and joint care refers to medical and lifestyle interventions aimed at
                    promoting the health and well-being of the elderly population's musculoskeletal system, including
                    bones and joints.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">With advancing age, individuals are at an increased risk of conditions like
                    osteoporosis (brittle bones) and osteoarthritis (joint degeneration), which can lead to pain,
                    reduced mobility, and fractures.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Regular exercise, including weight-bearing activities and strength training, can help
                    maintain bone density, muscle strength, and joint flexibility in older adults.
                    Adequate nutrition, particularly sufficient calcium and vitamin D intake, is crucial for maintaining
                    bone health and preventing osteoporosis.

                    Common conditions affecting muscles and the skeleton, or the musculoskeletal system.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The cartilage within the joint breaks down, causing pain and stiffness. the bones
                    become soft, due to problems with the metabolism of vitamin D. muscle weakness and pain any of the
                    above conditions can affect the proper functioning of the associated muscles.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Muscles are less toned and less able to contract because of changes in the muscle
                    tissue and normal aging changes in the nervous system. Muscles may become rigid with age and may
                    lose tone, even with regular exercise.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Breakdown of the joints may lead to inflammation, pain, stiffness, and deformity.
                    Joint changes affect almost all older people. These changes range from minor stiffness to severe
                    arthritis.</p>

                        muscle</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">Muscle loses size and strength as we get older, which can contribute to fatigue,
                        weakness and reduced tolerance to exercise. This is caused by a number of factors working in
                        combination.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Muscle fibres reduce in number and shrink in size. Muscle tissue is replaced more
                        slowly and lost muscle tissue is replaced with a tough, fibrous tissue.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> Changes in the nervous system cause muscles to have reduced tone and ability to
                        contract. Bone is living tissue. As we age, the structure of bone changes and this results in
                        loss of bone tissue. Low bone mass means bones are weaker and places people at risk of breaks
                        from a sudden bump or fall.</p>
