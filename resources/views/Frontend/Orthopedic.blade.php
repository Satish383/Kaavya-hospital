                <p class="mb-4">Anterior Cruciate Ligament surgery, also known as ACL surgery, is a procedure that
                    involves the repair or reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, which is located in the
                    middle of the knee. An ACL is a vital soft tissue structure that connects the femur (a thigh or
                    upper hindlimb bone that articulates at the hip and knee) to the tibia (the inner and typically
                    larger of the two bones between the knee and the ankle).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">These types of injuries, whether partial or complete, are most common among athletes.
                    Sports medicine physicians and orthopaedic surgeons typically perform ACL reconstruction surgery,
                    replacing the torn ligament with a tissue graft to mimic or replicate the natural ACL and it is done
                    arthroscopically and hence it becomes a minimally invasive surgery</p>

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">Knee replacement surgery is a surgical procedure used to resurface an arthritic or
                    damaged knee. People with severe arthritis or knee injuries are typically considered for this
                    surgery, in which metal and plastic parts are used to cap the ends of the knee bones and the
                    kneecap. Surgery to replace a knee joint is also called knee arthroplasty or total knee replacement.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">The knee joint is affected by various types of arthritis. For example, osteoarthritis
                    is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects middle-aged and older adults, causing the
                    breakdown of joint cartilage and adjacent knee bones. Rheumatoid arthritis causes synovial membrane
                    inflammation, which increases synovial fluid and causes pain and stiffness in the knee joint.
                    Traumatic arthritis develops as a result of an injury to the knee cartilage. The primary goal of
                    knee replacement surgery is to resurface damaged knee parts and relieve pain that other methods
                    cannot reduce.</p>

                        Surgery</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">A shoulder replacement is a surgical procedure that replaces the damaged parts of
                        the shoulder joint with prostheses, eliminating the source of pain and dysfunction. As a result,
                        this surgery will assist a person in relieving pain, improving strength, and increasing arm and
                        shoulder flexibility. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tear arthropathy, avascular necrosis, and rheumatoid
                        arthritis are all common reasons for shoulder replacement surgery.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Hip replacement surgery, also known as hip arthroplasty, is a procedure used to
                        relieve hip pain. It uses artificial implants to replace parts of the hip joint. The hip joints
                        are made up of a ball at the top of the femur, known as the thigh bone, and a socket in the
                        pelvis, known as the hip bone.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The surgery involves the replacement of one or both parts. The surgery's primary
                        goal is for you to be able to resume your daily activities and have a painless range of motion
                        or movements at the hip joint with a stable and painless hip joint.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">It is a procedure in which an orthopaedic surgeon uses a small piece of equipment
                        called an arthroscope to investigate, evaluate and treat knee problems. A surgeon inserts a
                        narrow tube connected to a fibre-optic video camera through a buttonhole-sized incision.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">A high-definition video monitor receives the view from inside your joint. It is a
                        less invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat joint problems. Most of the knee
                        ligament injuries like ACL, PCL and meniscal tears are treated with this minimally invasive
                        procedure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Knee arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera to look inside your knee.
                        Small cuts are made to insert the camera and small surgical tools into your knee for the
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">A narrow tube with a tiny camera on the end will be inserted through one of the
                        cuts. The camera is attached to a video monitor that lets the surgeon see inside the knee.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The surgeon may put other small surgery tools inside your knee through the other
                        cuts. The surgeon will then fix or remove the problem in your knee. At the end of your surgery,
                        the saline will be drained from your knee.</p>
