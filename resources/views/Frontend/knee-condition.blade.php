                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">Knee pain is a common complaint among adults and most often associated with general
                    wear and tear from daily activities like walking, bending, standing and lifting. Athletes who run or
                    play sports that involve jumping or quick pivoting are also more likely to experience knee pain and
                    problems. But whether an individual's knee pain is caused by aging or injury, it can be a nuisance
                    and even debilitating in some circumstances.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The knee is a vulnerable joint that bears a great deal of stress from everyday
                    activities, such as lifting and kneeling, and from high-impact activities, such as jogging and
                    aerobics.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Ligaments are elastic
                    bands of tissue that connect bone to bone. Some ligaments on the knee provide stability and
                    protection of the joints, while other ligaments limit forward and backward movement of the tibia
                    (shin bone).</p>

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">When someone is injured, it's important to assess the situation to determine the
                    severity of the injury. This could involve asking questions about the mechanism of injury, the
                    location of pain, and any accompanying symptoms.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A healthcare provider will perform a physical examination to assess the injured area.
                    They will look for signs of swelling, bruising, deformity, and changes in range of motion. They may
                    gently palpate the area to identify areas of tenderness or instability.</p>

                        and bones</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">If you need surgery to repair tendons, ligaments or cartilage, your healthcare
                        provider uses specially designed tools.The camera shows real-time images that guide your
                        healthcare provider during the procedure. Your healthcare provider uses tiny tools to repair and
                        reconstruct soft tissues by stitching them together. They can also suture (stitch) bones
                        together.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">A qualified healthcare provider, such as an orthopedic surgeon, will evaluate the
                        extent of the injury through physical examination, imaging (X-rays, MRI, CT scans), and
                        sometimes laboratory tests. This assessment helps determine the best course of treatment.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> Pain control is important during the recovery process. It might involve
                        medication, physical therapy modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound), and other pain management
                        techniques.</p>
