                <p class="mb-4">Whether you have just begun exploring treatment options or have already decided to
                    undergo hip replacement surgery, this information will help you understand the benefits and
                    limitations of total hip replacement.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If your hip has been damaged by arthritis, a fracture, or other conditions, common
                    activities such as walking or getting in and out of a chair may be painful and difficult. Your hip
                    may be stiff, and it may be hard to put on your shoes and socks. You may even feel uncomfortable
                    while resting.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If medications, changes in your everyday activities, and the use of walking supports
                    do not adequately help your symptoms, you may consider hip replacement surgery.</span></p>

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">The hip is one of the body's largest joints. It is a ball-and-socket joint. The socket
                    is formed by the acetabulum, which is part of the pelvis bone. The ball is the femoral head, which
                    is the upper end of the femur (thighbone).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The bone surfaces of the ball and socket are covered with articular cartilage, a
                    smooth tissue that cushions the ends of the bones and enables them to move easily.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hip pain can range from a temporary, short-term annoyance to a bigger issue that needs
                    treatment from a healthcare provider. Where you feel the pain depends on which part of your hip
                    joint is damaged.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A thin tissue called the synovial membrane surrounds the hip joint. In a healthy hip,
                    this membrane makes a small amount of fluid that lubricates the cartilage and eliminates almost all
                    friction during hip movement.</span></p>

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">Common Causes of Hip Pain
                    </h5>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">The most common cause of chronic hip pain and disability is arthritis. Osteoarthritis,
                    rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic arthritis are the most common forms of this disease.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">This is an age-related wear and tear type of arthritis. It usually occurs in people 50
                    years of age and older and often in individuals with a family history of arthritis. The cartilage
                    cushioning the bones of the hip wears away. The bones then rub against each other, causing hip pain
                    and stiffness. Osteoarthritis may also be caused or accelerated by subtle irregularities in how the
                    hip developed in childhood.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Hip pain is a common symptom that can be caused by anything from sports injuries to
                    arthritis. You can usually treat hip pain at home by taking a break from physical activities and
                    taking over-the-counter pain relievers. But if the pain persists or gets worse, other treatments may
                    be necessary.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">This is an autoimmune disease in which the synovial membrane becomes inflamed and
                    thickened. This chronic inflammation can damage the cartilage, leading to pain and stiffness.
                    Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common type of a group of disorders termed inflammatory
                    arthritis.</span></p>
