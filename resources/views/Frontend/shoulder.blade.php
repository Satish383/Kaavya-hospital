                <p class="mb-4">Shoulder surgery in orthopedics refers to a range of surgical procedures performed by
                    orthopedic surgeons to address various shoulder conditions, injuries, and disorders. Orthopedic
                    shoulder surgery aims to alleviate pain, improve shoulder function, and enhance overall quality of
                    life. Here are some key aspects of shoulder surgery in the field of orthopedics:</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The word arthroscopy comes from two Greek words, "arthro" (joint) and "skopein" (to
                    look). The term literally means "to look within the joint." During shoulder arthroscopy, your
                    surgeon inserts a small camera, called an arthroscope, into your shoulder joint. The camera displays
                    pictures on a video monitor, and your surgeon uses these images to guide miniature surgical
                    instruments.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Shoulder arthroscopy has been performed since the 1970s. It has made diagnosis,
                    treatment, and recovery from surgery easier and faster than was once thought possible. Improvements
                    to shoulder arthroscopy occur every year as new instruments and techniques are developed.

                        is Recommended</h5>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">Your doctor may offer surgery as an option for a torn rotator cuff if your pain does
                    not improve with nonsurgical methods. Continued pain is the main indication for surgery. If you are
                    very active and use your arms for overhead work or sports, your doctor may also suggest surgery.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">External fixator types divide into several different subcategories, including
                    uniplanar, multiplanar, unilateral, bilateral, and circular fixators. By adding pins in different
                    planes (i.e., placed perpendicular to each other), one can create a multiplanar construct. Uniplanar
                    fixation devices are fast and easy to apply but are not as sturdy as multiplanar fixation.</p>

                    </h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">During arthroscopy, your surgeon inserts a small camera, called an arthroscope,
                        into your shoulder joint. The camera displays a live video feed on a monitor, and your surgeon
                        uses these images to guide miniature surgical instruments.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Because the arthroscope and surgical instruments are small and thin, your surgeon
                        can use very small incisions (portals), rather than the larger incision needed for standard,
                        open surgery.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> All-arthroscopic repair is usually an outpatient procedure and is the least
                        invasive method to repair a torn rotator cuff.</p>
