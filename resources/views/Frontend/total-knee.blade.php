                    <h1 class="display-5 mb-0 text-success">Revision Total Knee Replacement</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">Total knee replacement is one of the most successful procedures in all of medicine. In
                    the vast majority of cases, it enables people to live richer, more active lives free of chronic knee
                    pain. Over time, however, a knee replacement may fail for a variety of reasons. When this occurs,
                    your knee can become painful and swollen. It may also feel stiff or unstable, making it difficult to
                    perform your everyday activities.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Although both procedures have the same goal — to relieve pain and improve function —
                    revision surgery is different than primary total knee replacement. It is a longer, more complex
                    procedure that requires extensive planning, and specialized implants and tools to achieve a good
                    result.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Damage to the bone may make it difficult for the doctor to use standard total knee
                    implants for revision knee replacement. In most cases, he or she will use specialized implants with
                    longer, thicker stems that fit deeper inside the bone for extra support.

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">Implant Loosening and Wear
                    </h5>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">In order for a total knee replacement to function properly, an implant must remain
                    firmly attached to the bone. During the initial surgery, the implant was either cemented into the
                    bone or press-fit to allow bone to grow onto the surface of the implant. In either case, the implant
                    was firmly fixed. Over time, however, an implant may loosen from the underlying bone, causing the
                    knee to become painful.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The cause of loosening is not always clear, but high-impact activities, excessive body
                    weight, and wear of the plastic spacer between the two metal components of the implant are all
                    factors that may contribute. Also, patients who are younger when they undergo the initial knee
                    replacement may "outlive" the life expectancy of their artificial knee. For these patients, there is
                    a higher long-term risk that revision surgery will be needed due to loosening or wear.</p>

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">Infection</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">Infection is a potential complication in any surgical procedure, including total
                        knee replacement. Infection may occur while you are in the hospital or after you go home. It may
                        even occur years later.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">If an artificial joint becomes infected, it may become stiff and painful. The
                        implant may begin to lose its attachment to the bone. Even if the implant remains properly fixed
                        to the bone, pain, swelling, and drainage from the infection usually make revision surgery
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> Revision for infection can be done in one of two ways, depending on the type of
                        bacteria, how long the infection has been present, the degree of infection, and patient
                        preferences.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">A primary knee arthroplasty is a very commonly performed procedure that involves a
                    patient undergoing a joint replacement for the first time. Essentially, the difference between this
                    and the revision knee replacement is that you're revising and changing a primary knee replacement to
                    a revised new replacement.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">There are certainly other differences from the point of view of the complexity of the
                    procedure. A patient may need a revision knee replacement for many different reasons, including
                    instability, pain, stiffness, infection or loosening.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">It's not necessarily the case that someone who's had a primary knee replacement
                    inevitably needs a revision knee replacement. It really depends on several different factors.

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">The main reason for replacing any arthritic joint with an artificial joint is to stop
                    the bones from rubbing against each other, which is the cause of knee joint pain. The main aim of
                    this Primary Total Knee Replacement Surgery is to help people return to many of their activities
                    with less everyday pain, knee joint pain with greater freedom of movement.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In this implant the femoral component is made of stainless steel and the tibial tray
                    and the insert are together made of polyethylene. The advantage it has is that more poly is
                    available and hence it lasts longer, also cost-wise it is cheaper than the other implants.</p>

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">Rotating Platform Knee</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">The Rotating Platform Knee is based on a revolutionary design technology, the
                        Mobile-bearing Knee. When patients bend their Knees, the surfaces of their joints roll and glide
                        against each other, allowing their knees to rotate as they bend.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Unlike traditional, Fixed-bearing Knee implants, Rotating Platform Knee Implants
                        are designed to mimic this natural movement. This rotation reduces the stress and wear on the
                        implant. Women may be especially interested in this technology, since their Knees rotate more
                        than those of a man during normal movement.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> The disadvantage of this Knee is that if there is a gross deformity or imbalance
                        in the ligament, then there are chances of dislocation of the Knee after using rotating platform
                        Knees.</p>
