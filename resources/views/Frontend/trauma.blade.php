                <p class="mb-4">Fractures and traumatic injuries happen unexpectedly. And while there's no way to
                    prepare for such an injury, it's comforting to know you are in experienced hands. Our experienced
                    surgeons are expert in handling Orthopaedic Trauma situations and perform minimally invasive
                    surgery. </p>
                <p class="mb-4">Trauma surgery is a surgical specialty which deals in trauma or accident related
                    surgeries. It requires years of training in trauma surgery and critical care. Trauma surgeons are
                    first required to stabilize the patient and then evaluating and managing the conditions of the
                    patient. In our hospital, we have a trauma team which consist of health care professionals from all
                    cadres like Orthopaedic Trauma Surgeon, General Surgeon, Neurosurgeon, Plastic Surgeon including
                    nurses and support staff who understand that the needs of the trauma patients are very different
                    from a planned surgery patient. </p>

                        fractures treated?</h5>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">The management of fractures has improved considerably with excellent outcomes over the
                    last few decades. These excellent outcomes can be obtained through early intervention by staying
                    relatively active whilst keeping the fractured segment immobilised and subsequent rehabilitation to
                    increase strength and range of motion.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Bespoke rehabilitation for each fracture based on patient and fracture characteristics
                    are crucial for optimising the outcomes and to restore previous pre-injury levels. A collaborative
                    multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach led by surgeons, anaesthetists, physiotherapist, occupational
                    therapists, pain specialists, and patients themselves will ultimately lead to return to pre-injury
                    activities of daily living, leisure, sport, and work.</p>

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">May surgery be required to
                        heal these complex injuries?</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">Orthopaedic injuries place the patient at risk for various complications,
                        including fat embolism, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and sepsis. Many studies have
                        documented the benefits of early stabilization in reducing morbidity and mortality. Early
                        definitive long bone fixation and external fixation methods have evolved and are considered an
                        integral part of the initial care.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Innovative techniques like computer-assisted surgery continues to develop as
                        technology improves. Uses in trauma include navigation for percutaneous screw placement in
                        trauma surgery and for replacement surgery for reconstruction of complex fractures.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> The ultimate target is to enable patients to return to their pre-injury levels.
                        Surgery might be the only option in many of the complex trauma presentations. All these patients
                        should be managed in a collaborative manner. Better understanding and identification of these
                        injuries enables us to optimise the outcomes.</p>
