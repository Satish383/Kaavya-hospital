                <p class="mb-4">Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that orthopaedic surgeons use to visualize and
                    treat problems inside a joint. The word arthroscopy comes from two Greek words, "arthro" (joint) and
                    "skopein" (to look). The term literally means "to look within the joint."</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In arthroscopic surgery, an orthopaedic surgeon makes a small incision in the patient's
                    skin, then inserts pencil-sized instruments that contain a small lens and lighting system to magnify
                    and illuminate the structures inside the joint. Light is transmitted through fiber optics to the end
                    of the arthroscope that is inserted into the joint.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">By attaching the arthroscope to a miniature camera, the surgeon is able to see the
                    interior of the joint through this very small incision, rather than the larger incision needed for
                    open surgery.

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">Your bones, cartilage, ligaments, muscles, and tendons can all be damaged by disease
                    and injury. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will take a thorough medical history, perform a
                    physical examination and order imaging studies — usually x-rays. For some conditions, an additional
                    imaging study — such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerized tomography (CT)
                    scan — may also be needed. After making a diagnosis, your doctor will determine the most appropriate
                    treatment choice for your condition.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Although the inside of nearly all joints can be viewed with an arthroscope, six joints
                    are most frequently examined with this instrument. These are the knee, shoulder, elbow, ankle, hip
                    and wrist. As advances are made in fiberoptic technology and new techniques are developed by
                    orthopaedic surgeons, other joints may be treated more frequently in the future.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Orthopaedic surgeons use arthroscopy to view inside joints. The minimally invasive
                    procedure takes place through small incisions. It enables providers to diagnose and treat problems
                    like arthritis, rotator cuff tears, carpal tunnel syndrome and ACL tears.</p>

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">How is arthroscopy
                        performed?</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">Arthroscopic surgery, although much easier in terms of recovery than open surgery,
                        still requires the use of anesthetics and the special equipment in a hospital operating room or
                        outpatient surgical suite. You will be given a general, spinal, or a local anesthetic, depending
                        on the joint or suspected problem.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">A small incision (about the size of a buttonhole) will be made to insert the
                        arthroscope. Several other incisions may be made to see other parts of the joint or insert other
                        instruments.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Corrective surgery is performed with specially designed instruments that are
                        inserted into the joint through accessory incisions. Originally, arthroscopy was simply a
                        diagnostic tool used for planning standard open surgery.</p>
