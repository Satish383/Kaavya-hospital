                <p class="mb-4">Whether you have just begun exploring treatment options or have already decided to
                    undergo hip replacement surgery, this information will help you understand the benefits and
                    limitations of total hip replacement.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If your hip has been damaged by arthritis, a fracture, or other conditions, common
                    activities such as walking or getting in and out of a chair may be painful and difficult. Your hip
                    may be stiff, and it may be hard to put on your shoes and socks. You may even feel uncomfortable
                    while resting.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If medications, changes in your everyday activities, and the use of walking supports
                    do not adequately help your symptoms, you may consider hip replacement surgery. Hip replacement
                    surgery is a safe and effective procedure that can relieve your pain, increase motion, and help you
                    get back to enjoying normal, everyday activities.</span></p>
