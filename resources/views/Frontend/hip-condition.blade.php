                <p class="mb-4">Your hip is the joint where your thigh bone and pelvis meet. Hips are called
                    ball-and-socket joints because the ball-like top of your thigh bone moves within a cup-like space in
                    your pelvis. Your hips are usually very stable, and it takes a great deal of force to hurt them.
                    Playing sports, running, overuse or falling can lead to hip injuries.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The University of Michigan Health System diagnoses and treats all types of hip
                    conditions, from acute injuries such as fractures to chronic, long-term degenerative issues.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">At University of Michigan, our integrated, multidisciplinary approach to treating hip
                    conditions enables us to provide our patients with efficient and effective care.

                <p class="mb-4">To make our diagnosis, we start with your clinical exam, conduct a thorough health
                    history, talk with you about your pattern of symptoms and take X-rays. Depending on what your X-rays
                    show, further imaging, such as a CT scan, MRI, ultrasound or arthrogram, may be required. Our
                    Radiology Services are state of the art and will help us determine how to treat your condition</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A simple visual examination of the hip may reveal a deformity or injury. Your doctor
                    will often manipulate your leg in different directions, looking for resistance, a popping sensation,
                    or pain. These can indicate the source of the hip problem. However, more tests may be necessary to
                    confirm a diagnosis.</p>

                        Conditions</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">If you have suffered any hip trauma, seek treatment right away. Failure to do so
                        risks further complications, such as chronic instability, weakness, pain or malunion (where a
                        fracture heals in a bad position that is difficult to undo). Getting that diagnosis quickly
                        means we can treat you while the injury is simpler to treat. But, even if a problem has been
                        misdiagnosed or is a long-term issue, we can still help.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Treatment varies widely, depending on the problem. Treatment for hip disorders may
                        include rest, medicines, physical therapy or surgery, including hip replacement. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> All-arthroscopic repair is usually an outpatient procedure and is the least
                        invasive method to repair a torn rotator cuff.</p>

                        and Conditions</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">We perform hundreds of hip surgeries each year, including hip arthroscopy and hip
                        replacement. We are on the forefront of orthopaedic technology, offering advanced techniques and
                        developing new procedures for difficult problems.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Hip arthroscopy is a minimally invasive approach used to diagnose and treat a wide
                        range of hip problems. In arthroscopy, a surgeon inserts special, small, surgical tools and a
                        video camera through a few small incisions (about the size of a buttonhole) to access the hip
                        joint.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Recovery time will vary depending on the surgery performed and in most cases open
                        surgery will require more time in the hospital and on crutches. A surgeon will decide between
                        open or arthroscopic surgery depending on many factors, such as the procedure being performed, a
                        patient's medical history, and preference.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The hip labrum is a ring of soft tissue that surrounds the hip socket. A torn hip
                        labrum may not heal on its own. Repair surgery is often recommended to patients who are
                        considered low risk and likely to have good post-surgical results.</p>
