                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint. The end of the upper arm bone (the humeral
                    head) forms the ball, while part of the shoulder blade (the glenoid) forms the socket.
                    Shoulder replacement surgery replaces the ball and sometimes the socket with man-made parts. There
                    are several types of shoulder replacement surgery</p>
                <p class="mb-4">An open fracture, in which a bone breaks through the skin, usually requires surgery to
                    reposition the bone, fix bone fragments into place, and close the wound. Doctors also recommend
                    surgery for displaced fractures, in which the pieces of a broken bone separate from each other but
                    remain beneath the skin.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A doctor may also recommend surgery if a fracture limits joint function—for example,
                    if a fracture in the elbow prevents the joint from extending fully—or if a bone fracture results in
                    damage to soft tissues such as tendons, ligaments, nerves, or blood vessels.</p>

                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">Our Surgical Approach</h5>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">When serious injuries such as open fractures occur, immediate surgery may be required
                    at NYU Langone. For less severe fractures, or if the injury causes significant swelling or bleeding,
                    surgery may be scheduled later to allow bleeding and swelling to lessen.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Your surgeon decides on the most appropriate surgical procedure for your shoulder or
                    elbow based on extent of the injury, what type of accident occurred, how much of the joint was
                    affected, and whether any blood vessels, nerves, tendons, or ligaments were damaged. </p>
            </div>

                <div class="section-title mb-4">
                    <h5 class="position-relative d-inline-block text-primary text-uppercase">Open Reduction and Fixation
                    </h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">NYU Langone surgeons perform open reduction and internal fixation using regional
                        or general anesthesia. This procedure is used to set a broken shoulder or elbow bone and
                        stabilize the bone fragments so they can heal. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In the elbow, open reduction and fixation may be performed for a fractured distal
                        humerus, the upper arm bone, or olecranon, the bony tip of the elbow. Fractures of the radial
                        head or scapula usually don't require surgery, but if a fracture interferes with joint function
                        or breaks the skin, doctors may need to operate. </p>
